## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.Js and MongoDB.

The project was built out using EJS to template the data outputs on the page using form submission. I used Javascript to switch it up by putting data in the from client side, to the serve and getting out the result from the database in MongoDB.


## Optimizations
I was able to get the private credentials hidden away from this file and linking it up with assigned variables and finally got it working flawlessly.

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt how these different tech languages communicate with each other and how easily things can break when the syntax is wrong. It was fun and educational building out this app. The knowleged gained from will be vital in developing other applications in the future.
